How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure I first need to adhere to the guidlines of SDLC when I can and follow best practices. By doing these two things I will ensure that my code has met all requirements and each of those has been tested to ensure completion. By following best practices, I will know that I have not left any obvious security vulnerabilities and that my code will hold up to professional standards.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When interpreting user needs I first ask my client questions so that I can get a feel for what they are expecting from the program past the surface. They could want all the program features in one place so they are easy to find or hidden in a drop down menu. If my client cant give me solid answers or is unsure about what they want, I generally try to create programs in a way that I would be happy with them and then go from there based on the opinions I get back.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software like I am having a conversation. The first step is getting to know the other side or client in this case. They tell me what they want and I tell them if I think I can meet their needs. Then it is my turn to lead the conversation so I ask questions and give my first rough observations about what I can offer them and what they will need past what they have told me. The final parts of the conversation are just me and what I recived from the client where I lay out everything that was discussed into what will eventually be functional software.
